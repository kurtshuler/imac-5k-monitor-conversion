## My goals and decisions

Here are the essentials if you want to turn a 2015 iMac into a standalone 5K monitor:

### üîå Driver Boards
- [R1811 V4 (with DP1.4 + HDMI 2.1 support)](https://stonetaskin.com/products/diy-5k-universal-r1811-v-4-driver-board-usb-c-freesync-edp-dp1-4-compatible-for-imac-lm270qq1-lm270qq2-screen-external-monitor-1) ‚Äî popular board for LM270QQ1 / LM270QQ2 panels.  
- [JRY-W9RQUHD-SA1](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006655038825.html) ‚Äî another option for 5K builds.  
- [DX-LP0818 Booster](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006529912490.html) ‚Äî required if your board setup needs an extra voltage step-up.

### ‚ö° Power Supplies
- [Meanwell LRS-250-24](https://www.meanwell-web.com/en-gb/ac-dc-enclosed-industrial-power-supply-output-lrs--250--24) ‚Äî robust 24V supply, widely used.  
- [Meanwell XLG-200-24-A](https://www.meanwell-web.com/en-gb/ac-dc-led-driver-constant-power-xlg--200--24--a) ‚Äî designed for LEDs, but many have used it successfully for monitors.  
- [Meanwell LRD-250-24](https://es.aliexpress.com/item/1005006614807022.html) ‚Äî another common choice (quiet & compact).  

### üñ•Ô∏è Panels
- **LM270QQ1 / LM270QQ2** ‚Äî the original iMac 27" 5K panels.  
- **LM270QQ3** ‚Äî newer revisions, sometimes supported by R1811/JRY boards (check seller specs!).
